Some useful shortcuts for C++
Right now there is:
* _r user defined string literal for regex creation.
* _sys for doing horrible things. TODO: replace with popen or some better variant.
* _env for getting environment variables.
* _error for bog standard std::runtime_errors.
* _format for format strings (sort of like a mixture of the old and new python ways). TODO: Support key word arguments and cleanup the unneccesary switch.
* TODO: Moar
